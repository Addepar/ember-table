Ember Table is a power table made for users who need a full-fledged,
fully-customizable table component for their apps. It is built to be flexible,
scalable, and ergonomic for day-to-day use.

Unlike other table components, Ember Table seeks to provide as many common table
features as it can _without_ sacrificing flexibility or composeability. You can
still use standard component idioms to customize, extend, and build on top of
Ember Table at every level, ensuring that it never gets in your way or prevents
you from doing what you want.
