# Ember Table

A table built using [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/) that lazily renders rows.

Ember Table allows you to handle very large data sets by only rendering the
rows that are being displayed. It is written as an ember component with an API
that is easy to understand and extend.


## Demo and Documentation

## Getting Started

#### JS Bin Starter Kit

http://emberjs.jsbin.com/xavipu/1/edit

#### Installation

With bower: `bower install ember-table --save`

Or, just include `dist/ember-table.js` and `dist/ember-table.css` in your app.

Once it's installed, you can customize the look of ember-table with CSS.

#### Developing or Testing

After cloning this repo, install dependencies and compile with grunt:

```bash
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
$ npm install
$ grunt
```

To view examples, start the node server. From the root directory:

`$ node examples.js`.

You can view the examples at http://localhost:8000/gh_pages.

You can run the tests at http://localhost:8000/tests.

## Dependencies
* ember
* jquery-ui
* jquery.mousewheel
* antiscroll

## Browser Support
We aim to support the last two major versions of every common browser.

If you need to support further browsers, we welcome pull requests with fixes.

Touch support may work but has not been tested.

## Contributing

Got something to add? Great! Bug reports, feature ideas, and (especially) pull
requests are extremely helpful, and this project wouldn't be where it is today
without lots of help from the community.

Please read the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for directions on
opening issues and working on the project.


## Versioning

Ember Table uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org) to keep track of
releases using the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

In a nutshell, this means:
* Breaking changes to the API or behavior increases the major version
* Adding functionality in a backwards-compatible way increases the minor version
* Making backwards-compatible bug fixes increases the patch version


### Maintainers
Update version numbers and release using https://github.com/webpro/grunt-release-it:

```
$ vim CHANGELOG.md
$ grunt release-it:<options>
```

By default, this will release a new patch version. Other suggested commands:

```
$ grunt release-it:minor
$ grunt release-it:major
$ grunt release-it:X.Y.Z
```

Ember Table uses the "distribution repository" feature of `release-it` to push to
the `gh-pages` branch and update documentation. When prompted, do NOT update the
tag for the distribution repository. We'll streamline the release process a bit
more soon.
